<p>The billable table shows how much time you are being billed for. Each call is rounded to the nearest minute. If your callers dial in, instead of using a microphone on their computer, that time is billed.</p>

<table id="billable_time">
  <tr>
    <th>Billable time</th>
    <th>Minutes</th>

  <tr>
    <td>Caller</td>
    <td><%= usage.caller_time %></td>

  <tr>
    <td>Leads</td>
    <td><%= usage.lead_time %></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
