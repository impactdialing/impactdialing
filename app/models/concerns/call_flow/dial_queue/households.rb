##
# Maintains sets of hashes defining household objects along with bitmaps
# defining call related flags.
#
## Key/Hash key schema
#
# Given a phone number 5554443321 and a campaign id of 42,
# the corresponding redis key will be
# `dial_queue:42:households:5554443` which accesses a redis hash.
# The corresponding hash key will be `321` which will return
# a JSON string of a household object, which includes a collection of leads as JSON.
#
# Keys using this schema:
#
# - :active
# - :presented
# - :inactive
#
## JSON schema
#
# {
#   sequence: int,
#   score: int, # the zset score to use initially or when enabling an inactive or completed house
#   blocked: int,
#   uuid: string, # not necessary with use of sequence but currently used in twiml, etc to track records
#   sql_id: int, # this is set after data is persisted to sql
#   leads: [
#     {
#       sequence: int,
#       uuid: string, # not necessary with use of sequence but currently used in twiml, etc 
#                     # to track records
#       sql_id: int, # this is set after data is persisted to sql
#       custom_id: string, # this is set only if mapped during upload
#       phone: string,
#       first_name: string,
#       last_name: string,
#       ...all Voter columns relevant for displaying info to callers...,
#       some_custom_field: string,
#       ...all fields mapped during upload that are not Voter columns...
#     }
#   ]
# }
#
# The key partitioning scheme uses the first 5 digits of the number
# as a component to the redis key and the remaining digits of the number
# as the component to the hash key. Some numbers may have more digits than
# others, eg if they include a country code. Currently no attempt is made
# to normalize phone numbers across country codes. For example if the number
# `5554443321` is added and then `15554443321` is added, they will define
# different households.
#
## Bitmap schema
#
# Household bitmaps are used to track whether specific leads have been completed or dispositioned
# and whether specific households have had messages dropped.
